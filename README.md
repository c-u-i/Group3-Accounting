<h3>BONUS:</h3>

If this is too simple, here some ideas how you can make the project more complex, potentially using more tools too:

- Save and load data to and from file, to use it later on
- Have a simple user management system that allows different users to register and log in the system, and store their data in different files
- Use a real db!
