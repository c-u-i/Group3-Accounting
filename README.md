<h2>PROJECT DESCRIPTION:</h2>
Users should be able to:

- Add expenses and earnings through the console
- Retrieve all previously inserted expenses and earnings
- Receive summaries and balances

<h3>BONUS:</h3>
If this is too simple, here some ideas how you can make the project more complex, potentially using more tools too:

- Save and load data to and from file, to use it later on
- Have a simple user management system that allows different users to register and log in the system, and store their data in different files
- Use a real db!
